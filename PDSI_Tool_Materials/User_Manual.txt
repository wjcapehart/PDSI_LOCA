------- Operation -------
- The MATLAB scripts must be in the current working folder in MATLAB. Data files 
can be placed anywhere.
- Open  and run PDSI_Tool_Launcher.m to start the tool.
- To operate the GUI, load your precipitation, temperature, and AWC data using the 
"Load Data" buttons, select your desired PET calculation method and calibration 
period, and click "Run".

------- Temperature and Precipitation Inputs -------
- The US Historical Climate Network (USHCN) has historical temperature and 
precipitation data available for US stations at 
http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ushcn/access.html.
- Data must be consecutive (i.e., no gaps) and combined into one .txt file. Do not 
include column headers.
- Data should be chronologically organized into four columns: Column 1 is the 
latitude in degrees, Column 2 is the year, Column 3 is temperature, and Column 4 is 
precipitation.
- Note that each temperature and precipitation observation must have a latitude and 
a year associated with it.
- If there are data for multiple locations, make sure that the data are arranged in the 
same order.
- Temperature and precipitation data should be input into the program in degrees 
Fahrenheit and inches, respectively.

-------- Available Water Capacity (AWC) Input --------
- Different locations have different field capacities. An AWC value for each location 
must be loaded into the program in inches.
- AWC data should be organized in a column in one .txt file. The AWCs should be 
organized in the same location order as the temperature and precipitation data.
- Note that only one AWC value is needed per location (i.e. the number of AWC 
values must equal the number of stations).

------- Calibration Period -------
- The calibration period is used to calculate the "Climatologically Appropriate for 
Existing Conditions" (CAFEC) precipitation for a location.
- The CAFEC is used to calculate weighting factors used in the Z-Index calculation 
(see Palmer, 1965).
- NOAA uses the period January 1931 to December 1990 as its calibration period 
(see Karl, 1986), and this option is provided.
- In the absence of long data records or to use a more comprehensive timespan, the 
option is also provided to use the full record as the calibration period.

------- Output Details -------
- Units for the output of the PET calculations are in inches. Main drought index 
outputs are PET, Z-Index, PDSI, and PHDI (see Palmer, 1965).
- Results are output into a text file (Palmer.txt) that is saved in the working folder of 
the current directory. The text file should be opened in Notepad or imported into 
Excel.
