function PET = Hamon_PET(T_F,lat_list,count_loc,beg_row_mat,lat_mat)

% Hamon_PET.m is a function file that calculates the monthly potential 
% evapotranspiration (PET) using the Hamon method (cf. Hamon, W.R., 1963;
% International Association of Scientific Hydrology, Pub. 63). Latitude is 
% required as an input to calculate the average monthly solar insolation.
% The average  monthly solar insolation and temperature are then used to  
% calculate the monthly potential evapotranspiration. 
%
% NOTE:
% T_F is the temperature in degrees F. This data should be input as a
% column vector.
% lat_list is the list of latitudes in the input data. There should be one
% latitude for each location, and this informatio should be input as a
% column vector.
% count_loc is the number of different locations in the input data.
% beg_row_mat is a vector of the row numbers where the temperature data for
% each of the different locations begins when the data is listed in a  
% matrix such that years represent rows and columns represent months.
% lat_mat is the record of latitudes in degrees for all locations arranged
% in a column vector, where a latitude is associated with each YEAR of the
% record for all locations.

%% ASSIGN VARIABLES
